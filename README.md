02. History and background of Pygal

    Pygal is an open-source Python library for creating charts and graphs that was first released in 2013. It was developed by the French programmer Kozea, who created the library as an alternative to other charting libraries that were either too complex or lacked interactivity.

    Initially, Pygal was designed to generate static SVG charts, but later versions added interactivity, allowing users to hover over data points for more information. The library also supports customization options such as color schemes, chart types, and data filtering.

    Today, Pygal is widely used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and education, for data visualization. It continues to evolve, with new features and updates being added regularly.

   To create a basic chart using Pygal, follow these steps:

    1. Import the Pygal library:
    
        import pygal
        
    2. Create a chart object:
    
        chart = pygal.Line()
        
    3. Add data to the chart:
    
        chart.add('Data Set Name', [1, 3, 2, 5, 4])
    
    4. Render the chart:
    
        chart.render_to_file('chart.svg')
